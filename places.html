  <p class="card-text"> Bhakra Dam is a concrete gravity dam across the Satluj River in Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh of North India. The dam, located at a gorge near the upstream Bhakra village in Bilaspur district of Himachal Pradesh of 226 m. Tehri Dam is the tallest dam of India having a height of 265 metres. The Dam has been measured from the road above it having a length of 518.25 metres and a width of 9.1 metres. Its reservoir stores up to 9.34 billion cubic metres which is named Gobind Sagar. The 90 km long reservoir created by the Bhakra Dam spans over an area of 168.35 sq kms. It ranks as the third largest reservoir in India, the first being Indira Sagar Dam in Madhya Pradesh holding a capacity of 12.22 billion cubic metres and second Nagarjunasagar Dam. <br>
  The Bhakra-Nangal multipurpose dams were among the earliest river valley development schemes undertaken by India after independence though the project had been conceived long before India became a free nation. The agreement for this project had been signed by the then Punjab Revenue Minister, Sir Chhotu Ram in November 1944 with Raja of Bilaspur and finalised the project plan on 8 January 1945. Preliminary works commenced in 1946. Construction of the dam started in 1948; Jawaharlal Nehru poured the first bucket of concrete into the dry riverbed of the Sutlej on 17 November 1955, as a symbolic initiation of the work. Addressing a gathering there, he said, "This is a gift to the people of India and to the future generations from the workers who built this dam", calling for "rais[ing] a memorial" at the dam "in honour" of the workers.[3] The dam was completed by the end of 1963. Successive stages were completed by the early 1970s. 
Initially, the construction of the dam was started by Sir Louis Dane, the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab. But the project got delayed and was restarted soon after independence under the chief architect Rai Bahadur Kunwar Sen Gupta. It was financed entirely by the union government. The Control Board for the project included representatives from union government, and of the governments of Punjab, Patiala and East Punjab States Union, Rajasthan, Bilaspur and Himachal Pradesh. The organisation evolved for the purpose of design and construction was divided into three parts. The Designs Directorate provided the designs and drawings. The Construction and Plant Design Directorate was to look after its execution and installing of the plant, while the Directorate of Inspection and Control ensured that the specifications are accorded to safety requirements were met.[4] 
In October 1963, at the ceremony to mark the dedication of the Bhakra–Nangal project to the nation, Prime Minister Nehru said, "This dam has been built with the unrelenting toil of man for the benefit of mankind and therefore is worthy of worship. May you call it a Temple or a Gurdwara or a Mosque, it inspires our admiration and reverence". On 22 October 2013, the Government of India approved the release of a commemorative stamp to mark the 50th anniversary of the Bhakra Dam. As how successful India was at that time that it was the only dam in Asia which could produce 1500 MW power. 
Also, these are multipurpose projects. </p>

    The reservoir lies in the Bilaspur District and Una District. Bilaspur is about 91 km away from the Bhakra Dam.[5] Its name given by Former Chairman of PSEB SardarJi Harbans Singh Somal, in honor of 10th Guru Gobind Singh Ji. In October and November, when the water level of the reservoir is high, a series of regattas are also organised by the Tourism and Civil Aviation department. Water-skiing, sailing, kayaking and water scooter racing are popular water sports activities during this period.Major attractions of the lake include ferry rides and water sports like speedboating. <br>
Gobind Sagar was declared as a water fowl refuge in 1962. Fishing is commonly practiced here. It has about fifty one species and sub species. Labeo dero, Tor picturata, Mystus seenghala and Mirror carp are some of the common species found here
    The unparalleled scenic view of rolling hills and plains overlooking the azure blue tint of the man-made reservoir of the Gobind Sagar lake is an alluring vista to gaze upon. The gigantic reservoir is formed on the Sutlej river by the Bhakra Dam, one of the highest gravity dams in the world. Built in 1963, The Bhakra dam stands as an iconic marvel of dam engineering. The multipurpose dam has given birth to a mighty artificial lake that encompasses an area of 170 square kilometres and is 90 kilometres long. Owing to its location and proximity to the Himalayan ranges, the lake is surrounded by lush greenery and an aura of tranquillity at every turn.

  <p class="card-text"> The Naina Devi Temple was built by Raja Bir Chand in the 8th century and is situated at a height of 1219m above sea level.<br>
  The area that is now Bilaspur District was formerly known as Kahlur, a princely state of British India. The ruler acceded to the Government of India on 12 October 1948, and Bilaspur was made an Indian state under a chief commissioner. The state of Bilaspur was merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 July 1954, and became Bilaspur District. 
Bilaspur was the capital of a state founded in the 7th century, and known as Kahlur after its earlier capital, or as Bilaspur after its later capital. The ruling dynasty were Chandela Rajputs, who claimed descent from the rulers of Chanderi in present-day Madhya Pradesh. The town of Bilaspur was founded in 1663. The state later became a princely state of British India, and was under the authority of the British province of Punjab. 
On 13 May 1665, Guru Tegh Bahadur went to Bilaspur to attend the mourning for Raja Dip Chand of Bilaspur. The Dowager Rani Champa of Bilaspur gave the Guru a piece of land in her state . The land consisted of the villages of Lodhipur, Mianpur and Sahota. Here on the mound of Makhowal, Guru Tegh Bahadur raised a new habitation. The ground was broken on 19 June 1665, by Baba Gurditta Randhawa. The new village was named after the Guru's mother, Nanaki. Chakk Nanaki later became famous as Anandpur Sahib. 
In 1932 state was made part of the newly created Punjab States Agency, and in 1936 the Punjab Hill States Agency was separated from the Punjab States Agency. India became independent in 1947, and on 12 October 1948 the ruler, HH Raja Sir Anand Chand, acceded to the Government of India. Bilaspur became a separate state of India under a chief commissioner, and on 1 July 1954 Bilaspur state was made a district of Himachal Pradesh state by an act of the Indian Parliament. The historic town was submerged in 1954 when the Sutlej River was dammed to create the Govind Sagar, and a new town was built upslope of the old. 
Most of the Rajputs in Bilaspur are Chandels, that is they belong to different branches of the ruling family. These families are numerous, and all enjoyed jagir pensions from state amounting in aggregate to Rs. 40,000 a year in 1933. They are called 'the Mian families', and the chief names are: Ajmerchandia, Kaliyanchandia, Tarahandia and Sultanchandia. </p>
